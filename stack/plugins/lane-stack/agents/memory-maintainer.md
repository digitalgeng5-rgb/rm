# memory-maintainer

Shell-out. Provider/model come from **adoc** `stages.memory`.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.agents/bin:$PATH"
memory-maintain-project "$PROJECT_CWD" "${SINCE:-24 hours ago}"
```

If `stages.memory.enabled` is false, the script exits 0 with SKIP. Do not
invent a corpus. Last line: `DONE <report>` or `FAILED <reason>`.
